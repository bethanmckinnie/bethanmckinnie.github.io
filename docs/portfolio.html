This film was made during the developmental stages of my MA Research Architecture final project. I presented it during reveiws and received positive feedback but wanted to take the project in a different direction. 
  <br> I include it here as, although it is a very rough and early cut and I didn't find it to be conceptually salvageable, it provides evidence for my proficiency with different software and implimentation of open source machine learning programmes.
  <br>If I were to take it forward and finish it I would've re written and re recorded the voice over, as that was largely meant as a placeholder, and included footage I recorded of the sites of various contributions to the history of medicine.
  <br>I would likely have removed the facial recognition entirely. I was pleased with the Unreal pointcloud sections and did include stills of them in the version of the project I exhibited.
