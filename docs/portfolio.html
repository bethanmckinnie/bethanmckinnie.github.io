<br><small>Unfinished Review Film - June 2024</small>
</h3>
<p id="para1">
This film was made during the developmental stages of my MA Research Architecture final project. I presented it during reveiws and received positive feedback but wanted to take the project in a different direction. 
  <br> I include it here as, although it is a very rough and early cut and I didn't find it to be conceptually salvageable, it provides evidence for my proficiency with different software and implimentation of open source machine learning programmes.
  <br>If I were to take it forward and finish it I would've re written and re recorded the voice over, as that was largely meant as a placeholder, and included footage I recorded of the sites of various contributions to the history of medicine.
  <br>I would likely have removed the facial recognition entirely. I was pleased with the Unreal pointcloud sections and did include stills of them in the version of the project I exhibited.
 <br><br>
 <b>Software: </b> 
  <br>
  Premier Pro, Meshroom, Blender, Unreal Engine
  <br> 
  <br>
  <b>Methodology:</b>
  <br>
  The animation commencing at 1'00" is the output of a open source facial recognition machine learning model.
  <br>
  The animation commencing at 2'09" is a photogrammetry model of the Old Operating Theatre in London Bridge. The meshroom pointcloud data was converted into 3D objects using Blender's geomoetry nodes, then lit and animated in Unreal Engine.
